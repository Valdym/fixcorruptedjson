# NTT DATA Case 

## TO - DO

1. Fix JSON Format and write back again to JSON file
   1. There is an incompatibility at line 4264 - I need to fix by counting [,{ and reformat it if necessary with this approach 
   I can make generic solution to any json file.
2. Designing database tables and writing values to table
   1. I'll use SQLAlchemy for ORM.
